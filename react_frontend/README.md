This is the frontend part of my project "Play 2 Games".<br />
It's a web where you can play 2-player games asynchronously with other users.

_You want to try this poject in your computer?<br />
Then you need to download too [The Backend in PHP/Laravel](https://github.com/ConradoZA/Final-Project-MySQLDB) and [The Backend in Node/mongoose](https://github.com/ConradoZA/Final-Project-MongoDB).<br />
Oh, and of course, have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your computer._
