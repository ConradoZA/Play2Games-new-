This is the PHP/Laravel part of the Backend of my project "Play 2 Games".<br />
It's a web where you can play 2-player games asynchronously with other users.

### Coded with 📋

* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) (of course)

### Getting started 🔧

_You want to try this poject in your computer?<br />
Then you need to download too [The Backend in PHP/Laravel](https://github.com/ConradoZA/Final-Project-MySQLDB) and [The Frontend in React](https://github.com/ConradoZA/Final-Project-Frontend).<br />
And of course, have [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed in your computer._

First run
```bash
composer install
```
to install the vendor folder.<br />
Then edit ".env.example" to ".env" and configure it with your own variables.<br />
<br />
Then run
```bash
php artisan serve
```
and your server will be listening in http://localhost:8000.<br />
<br />
Remember to start the other backend and the frontend too!

### Seeding 🌱

Artisan comes with it's own tools to seed:
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```
<br />
...Or, you can use my custom-made script "migrate.sh" to migrate all the tables, seed them and install their Passport keys all at once:
```bash
sh migrate.sh
```
